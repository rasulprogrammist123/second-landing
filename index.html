        <span  class="iph1">CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA <i>Apple</i> today debuted <b>iPhone 15 Pro</b> and <b>iPhone 15 Pro Max</b>, <br>
        designed with aerospace-grade titanium that’s strong yet lightweight to deliver <br>
        <i>Apple’s</i> lightest Pro models ever. The new design also features contoured edges and a <br>
        customizable Action button, allowing users to personalize their iPhone experience. Powerful <br>
        camera upgrades enable the equivalent of seven pro lenses with incredible image quality, including <br>
        a more advanced 48MP Main camera system that now supports the new super-high-resolution 24MP default,<br>
        the  next generation of portraits with Focus and Depth Control, improvements to Night mode and Smart HDR,<br>
        and an all-new 5x Telephoto camera exclusively on <b>iPhone 15 Pro Max</b>. A17 Pro unlocks next-level gaming <br> 
        experiences and pro performance. The new USB‑C <br>
        connector is supercharged with USB 3 speeds — up to 20x faster than USB 2 — and together with new video formats, <br> 
        enables powerful pro workflows that were not possible before.1 And with the addition of <br> 
        Roadside Assistance via satellite, the <b>iPhone 15 Pro</b> lineup builds <br>
        on <i>Apple’s</i> innovative satellite infrastructure to connect users to help if they have car trouble while off the grid.

        <span  class="iph2">A Stunning, Lightweight, and Durable Design Available in 6.1-inch <br> and 6.7-inch display sizes,2 <b>iPhone 15 Pro</b> and <b>iPhone 15 Pro Max</b>feature <br> a strong and lightweight 
        titanium design — a first for <br> <b>iPhone</b>. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of <br> the highest strength-to-weight 
        ratios of any metal, <br> making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush <br> texture, contoured edges, 
        and the thinnest <br> borders on <b>iPhone</b>. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium <br> with the toughest back glass in a 
        smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield <br> on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, <br> the titanium bands 
        encase a new substructure made from 100 <br> percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength <br> through solid-state diffusion. 
        The aluminum frame helps with thermal <br> dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design <br> highlights the Super Retina XDR 
        display <br> with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.
